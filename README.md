Project Name - Implementation of Merkle Tree

Summary : 
Our project is mainly focused to check transaction integrity using the data structure Merkle Tree. 
Basically a Merkle Tree stores data in the from of hashes so each data that is stored in a merkle
tree is secured by a Hash Function. A merkle tree is almost a complete binary tree. Each merkle tree has 
a root node generated by the MD5 algorithm, this root node is compared to check the transaction integrity.
If someone tries to tamper any data, i.e., any transaction then the root node is changed thus to check the 
transaction integrity we only need to check the root of the tree and not all the nodes. Our program also 
finds which transaction is tampered.

Input:
     It will ask for number of transaction ---  example 4
     It will ask to enter transaction (format: sender,receiver,data) --- (1) ram,mohan,40
                                                                         (2) shyam,rohan,80
                                                                         (3) priya,neha,20
                                                                         (4) suyog,arnav,90
    Then it ask for transaction number to tamper --- example 1
    Then it ask for the updated transaction      --- ram,mohan,20

Output:
    First it will print merkle tree both original and tampered which print hashes of each level --- example level 0(1 hash) , level 1(2 hash) , level 2(4 hash)
    It will print "transaction tampered" if merkle root of original tree and tampered tree is different
    It will print merkle root of both tree.
    It will print original and tampered data
